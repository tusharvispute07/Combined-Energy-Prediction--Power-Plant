# Combined-Energy-Prediction--Power-Plant
In this project, Energy generated by a combined cycle power plant is predicted as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables.

A combined-cycle power plant comprises - gas turbines, steam turbines and heat recovery steam generators. In this type of plant, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines combined in one cycle. Then, it is transfered from one turbine to another. In this project, I have modeled the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables for prediction to improve the plant's performance.

Regression models - Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Multilinear Regression ;
Regularization Techniques - Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regularization;
Boosting Techniques - XGBoost Regressor, Random Forrest Regressor;

are used in this project to predict the energy production.

### Data Set Details:
The set used contains 9568 observations with five variables collected from a combined cycle power plant over six years, when the poewr plant was set to work with a full load.
