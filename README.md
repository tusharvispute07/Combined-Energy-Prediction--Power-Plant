# Combined-Energy-Prediction--Power-Plant
In this project, Energy generated by a combined cycle power plant, as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables, is predicted.

![Combined Cycle Power Plant](https://power.mhi.com/group/msc/business/products/combined)

A combined-cycle power plant comprises - gas turbines, steam turbines and heat recovery steam generators. In this type of plant, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines combined in one cycle. Then, it is transfered from one turbine to another. In this project, I have to modeled the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables for prediction to improve the plant's performance.
